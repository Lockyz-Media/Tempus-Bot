# Tempus Bot: Translations
## DO NOT TRANSLATE STRINGS WITH ENGLISH IN THE TITLE. BE SURE TO KEEP THOSE STRINGS IN ENGLISH.
For example under the language value you will find nameEnglish and dialectEnglish. Both of these are in English to help the bot work better. Do not change these to any language other then English.

English is the bots "default" and "fallback" language, if a specific language key cannot be found in a specific language it will always fall back to the English (global) language.
## What languages are currently finished?
- English

## What languages need to be done?
- German (de.json)
- French (fr.json)
- English-UWU (en-UWU.json)
- English-US (en-US.json)
- Dutch (nl.json)

## What language code system do you use?
We use a modified version of ISO 639-1 language code system where instead of just having the language code, we also occasionally include a region code (based upon ISO 3166-1) for specific dialects. For example en-UWU for our custom English OWO dialect or en-US for US English.

You can find a list of all codes and languaes contained within here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes.

If you would like to suggest a language please consult the list above before making a pull request.
