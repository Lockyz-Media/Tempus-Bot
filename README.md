## What languages need to be done?

## What language code system do you use?
We use a modified version of ISO 639-1 language code system where instead of just having the language code, we also occasionally include a region code (based upon ISO 3166-1) for specific dialects. For example en-UWU for our custom English OWO dialect or en-US for US English.

You can find a list of all codes and languaes contained within here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes.

If you would like to suggest a language please consult the list above before making a pull request.
